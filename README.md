# SpotifySongNameApp
Quick and easy way for streamers to show their currently playing track from Spotify in OBS
I wrote this after hearing some streamers describe their frustration with other plugins that are pay for play or having to jump through a lot of hoops to get the song name to display on screen.

## Using SpotifySongNameApp with OBS
### To get this going
1. Launch OBS
2. Launch SpotifySongNameApp.exe
3. Move the app where you'd like. It's currently set to be the top-most window, so if you don't want it to interfere, move it to the edge of your monitor or to a secondary screen. Note: You'll have to click and drag the black background.  Don't try to drag by the Spotify logo or the text.
3. Add a WindowCapture object for [SpotifySongNameApp.exe]Form1

### To quit the app
Right-click the taskbar icon and choose close.
